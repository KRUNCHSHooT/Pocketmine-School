## About PocketMine School

This version of PocketMine School **is a fork of** [**TeamUltraSoft's original PocketMine School**](https://github.com/TeamUltraSoft/Pocketmine-School), which is currently unmaintained.

This version of PocketMine School **is currently maintained by** [**KygekTeam**](https://github.com/KygekTeam).

## Why do we fork PocketMine School?

The orginal PocketMine School has been left unmaintained for over 6 months as of writing this page, **yet there are many changes to be made**. Forking PocketMine School also **gives us flexibility to add contents** without having to submit pull requests to the repository.

## Can I contribute to PocketMine School?

Until the original PocketMine School goes back maintained, **we do not recommend you to submit pull requests or issues in the original PocketMine School repository**. You can submit [pull requests](https://github.com/KygekTeam/Pocketmine-School/pulls) or [issues](https://github.com/KygekTeam/Pocketmine-School/issues) in this fork repository instead, which will be reviewed by KygekTeam staffs.

As soon as the orginal PocketMine School goes back maintained, **we will try submitting a pull request to the original repo unless TeamUltraSoft approves KygekTeam to be the new maintainer**.

## Credits

**All credits goes to** [**TeamUltraSoft**](https://github.com/TeamUltraSoft), as the original PocketMine School creator and maintainer.
